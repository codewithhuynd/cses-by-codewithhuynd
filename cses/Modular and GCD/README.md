# Modular and GCD â€“ CSES Solutions

This folder contains my solutions to CSES problems related to **modular arithmetic** and **GCD (Greatest Common Divisor)**.

Each file includes clean C++ code with comments to help you understand the logic step by step.

Some common topics:
- Binary exponentiation
- Modular inverse
- Euclidean algorithm
- Extended GCD

ðŸŽ¥ I also make video explanations for these problems on my YouTube channel:
